Write your about information in markdown format below.

```markdown
This is my customized Blog project The Vibe Blog.  

It is one, among many other projects, that I will populate the Projects section with. 

I built this VibeCoding with ClaudeCode and added an easy to use AI interface on top of a Django platform so I can easily update the site dynamically with natural language, and I don't have to remember any workflow beyond asking the site to do something.
